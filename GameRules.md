# Bamboozle (House Rules)

### Credit for Rules
"Since the rules that come with Bamboozle are completely useless since there is no way a team can guess words in less time than it takes the other team to make them up, Iâ€™ve completely rewritten the rules."

### Equipment:
* Letter shaker (App will provide)
* 1 minute timer (App will provide)
* Pencil and paper for both teams


### Setup:
* Divide up into two teams
* Give each team several sheets from the pad and a pen or pencil.

### How To Play:
1.	Pick 1 person from each team to go first.
2.	Have someone besides the selected players use the letter shaker to get the 5 letters that will be used for the round.  The selected players should not see the letters until the timer is started.
3.	Start the timer and place the letter shaker where the two selected players can see the letters.
4.	The selected players have until the timer runs out to come up with one word for each letter.  If there is a blank cube, each player decides what letter they want it to represent.  Do not divulge to the other team what letter you select!
5.	Once the timer is out, the players can finish any word that they are currently writing, but may not write any other words regardless of whether they have written all 5 words.
6.	Next, the two players who wrote the words exchange lists with each other.  Be careful not to show anyone else the words!
7.	Randomly select a team to go first.  The starting team does not have any advantage.
8.	Start the timer.  The person on the selected team with the word list must try to get their team to guess the words written on the list.  Players have two options of how to get their team to guess the words.  They may give verbal clues, or act out the word like in charades.  For every word that is guessed correctly from verbal clues, that team gets 1 point.  For every word that is guessed correctly from gestures only, that team receives 2 points.  You do not have to use the same method for every word.  You can choose to act out two words via gestures and the other three via verbal clues.  If the person giving the clue says any part of the word, the other team gets 1 point and the word is skipped.
9.	Once the timer runs out, add the appropriate points to that teams score.
10.	Repeat steps 8 and 9 with the other team.
11.	The first team to reach 30 points wins the game!
